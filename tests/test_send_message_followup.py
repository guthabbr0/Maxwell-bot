"""Regression tests for send_message vs leftover plaintext.

2026-08-02: a "checking…" placeholder via send_message dropped the later
follow-up answer. 2026-08-14: leftover assistant content on the SAME
generation as send_message posted a second Discord reply ping.

2026-09-06: after send_message, a short filler follow-up with no tool
(the model writing "ok" instead of no_response) posted a second Discord
reply. Dispatcher now drops that leftover and ends the turn.
