# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Custom streaming tool-call protocol
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Native OpenAI-style tool_calls= doesn't stream incrementally on
# minimax-m3:cloud (or similar Ollama-cloud chat completion models): the
# entire {name, arguments} block arrives in ONE final delta at 88-100% of
# stream time, leaving the bot's "working on it…" progress message silent
# for the full 10-30s of generation.
#
# The "bare JSON on its own line" protocol sidesteps this: the model emits
# the tool call as part of the normal text stream (not the API's tool_calls
# field), and our SSE reader incrementally extracts it AS IT STREAMS. The
# model already knows raw JSON (no new syntax to learn) and the marker
# lands at ~12% of stream time vs ~88% for native — a real per-token
# progress signal for the user.
#
# Protocol shape (one JSON object on its own line, no fence, no tag):
#
#     {"name": "<tool>", "arguments": {<JSON object>}}
#
# The text around the JSON (the model's reply to the user) is preserved
# as normal assistant content. The JSON object is stripped from the
# visible reply so the user doesn't see raw JSON, but is captured into
# the ProviderResult.tool_calls so the rest of the dispatch flow treats
# it exactly like a native tool call.
#
# Streaming extraction (custom_tool_call_buffer below) does this:
#   1. Accumulates text deltas into a single buffer.
#   2. As soon as a `{"name": "..."` substring is visible, fires a
#      ``on_partial_name`` callback so the progress message can switch
#      from "thinking: …" to "<tool>: …" — even if the args haven't
#      finished streaming.
#   3. As soon as the outer JSON's closing brace is matched (counting
#      braces + tracking strings/escapes), parses it and returns a
#      native-format tool call list.
#   4. Continues looking for more tool calls (the model can chain
#      several in one response).
#
# The parser is conservative: if braces don't balance, the buffer is
# retained (we haven't hit the closing brace yet, just keep streaming).
# If JSON.parse fails on what we thought was complete, we rewind by one
# character and try again — handles the edge case where a brace inside
# a string fooled the counter.

# Matches the opening of a tool call — `{"name": "<tool>"`. We use this to
# find the start position even before we know the full JSON will parse.
_CUSTOM_TOOL_OPEN_RE = re.compile(r'\{\s*"name"\s*:\s*"([^"\\]*(?:\\.[^"\\]*)*)"')

# Opener-match failure recovery threshold. If the brace counter can't find
# a balanced close inside this many characters after a `{"name":` match,
# we give up on this opener and look for the next one. Prevents a single
# pathological opener (think: create_site's HTML body with embedded
# unbalanced `'{"name": "...' substrings from a prior tool's args, or
# a stray `"` inside CSS that strands the string-state counter) from
# silently disabling extraction for the rest of the stream.
_GIVE_UP_BYTES = 65536

# When no opener regex match is found in the unreleased buffer, how many
# bytes of recent text we hold back before emitting everything else as
# visible. The opener `{"name": "<value>"` can be up to ~50 chars depending
# on the tool name; 256 chars is comfortably larger and keeps a near-zero
# memory footprint. This is what lets the buffer find a tool call whose
# opener arrives split across many small SSE deltas — without it, the
# leading chunk would be released as visible and the partial opener lost
# forever.
_HOLD_BACK = 256

# Conservative upper bound on the length of one opener match
# (e.g. `{"name": "<30-char tool name>"}`). If the unreleased tail is
# no longer than this, no future chunk can still split an opener

# constant from _HOLD_BACK (which is the "ambiguous" window for chunks
# still arriving) makes the intent obvious at the call site.

        Design: ``_buf`` is the running buffer. ``_released_len`` is the
        byte offset up to which text has been emitted as visible. On
        each feed:
          1. Append delta to _buf.
          2. Search _buf for the first opener past _released_len.
          3. If found, the text from _released_len to the opener is
             plain visible — emit it now and advance _released_len to
             the opener position. Then try to find a balanced end for
             the opener.
          4. If balanced end found, parse the candidate. Real tool
             call → append to completed, advance _released_len past
             the closer, and loop. Parse fail / wrong shape → advance
             past opener's first char (false-positive recovery) and
             loop.
          5. If no balanced end (opener mid-JSON): hold; the prefix
             already released covers everything safe. Any text after
             the opener (still buffering) is hidden.
          6. If no opener at all in the buffer: emit everything up to
             ``len(_buf) - _HOLD_BACK`` as visible. The trailing
             _HOLD_BACK window is held back so a chunk boundary can't
             split a fresh opener (max opener length is ~50 chars;

        Works regardless of chunk size: we always search the full _buf

        deltas is found the moment the closing brace arrives. Text
        before the opener is released immediately, so the caller sees

    """Read an OpenAI-style SSE chat-completions stream and reassemble it into
    the same dict shape a non-streamed `await resp.json()` would return.

    If ``on_tool_call_name`` is provided, it's awaited the first time a
    tool_call delta arrives with a function name. This lets the caller
    update a live progress message mid-stream — e.g. show
    "create_site: …" while the model is still generating the tool arguments
    (the HTML body), instead of waiting for the entire response to finish.

    If ``on_token`` is provided, it's called (fire-and-forget, NEVER awaited
    inline) on every content and reasoning delta so the caller can show a
    live progress message with a rolling preview of the model's own words.
    Inline awaiting would back-pressure the SSE read on a slow Discord edit
    and stall the upstream. The callback gets a small dict with the new
    delta (NOT an accumulator) plus a flag distinguishing reasoning from
    visible content::

        {"reasoning": str, "content": str, "tool_name": str|None}

    ``tool_name`` is set only on the delta that first introduces a tool call
    name (so the callback can switch the progress UI from "model is
    thinking" to "tool_name: …" the moment the model decides).

    The OpenAI streaming protocol sends one JSON object per ``data:`` line, each
    with the same frame structure but only the *delta* of what changed since
    the previous frame:

        data: {"choices": [{"delta": {"role": "assistant"}, "index": 0}]}
        data: {"choices": [{"delta": {"content": "hello"}, "index": 0}]}
        data: {"choices": [{"delta": {"content": " world"}, "index": 0}]}
        data: {"choices": [{"delta": {"tool_calls": [...]}, "index": 0}]}
        data: {"choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
        data: [DONE]

    We accumulate content strings, tool_calls (pinned by ``index``), and any
    usage payload that streams in at the end, then return a dict that matches
    the non-streamed response shape so the rest of the request handler does
    not need to care which mode produced the response.

    Returns the merged dict, plus (via a sentinel) the time the first content
    delta was received — encoded as ``__first_token_ms__`` in the returned
    dict and popped by the caller.

    Raises RuntimeError if the stream is malformed (no choices ever arrive) so
    the upstream retry logic can take over.
